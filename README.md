### What is this repository for? ###

This is the repository for the neXtSIM sea-ice model, developed at the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, Bergen, Norway. NeXtSIM is a research tool used in several scientific publications. It is also used in the Copernicus Marine Service's Arctic sea ice [forecast](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description) and [reanalysis](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_MULTIYEAR_PHY_ICE_002_016/description).

If you use neXtSIM for a project, please cite [Rampal et al. (2016](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/10/1055/2016/) and [Ã“lason et al. (2022)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002685). Please make any modifications available and findable or contribute them to the original code by creating a pull request on Git Hub.

### How do I get set up? ###
