v. 1.94.0
   PS 21032019
   -- Added entry ERROR_STD_MIN to obstypes parameter file to specify minimal
      allowed error standard deviation for an observation type.
   -- Made HFUNCTION entry optional, with the default value "standard".
v. 1.93.4
   PS 15032019
   -- Moved checks for observations being in allowed spatial domains for their
      type (XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX, ZMIN, ZMAX) from readers to obs_add().
v. 1.93.3
   PS 14032019
   -- In obs_add() implemented filtering by ot->zmin and ot->zmax.
   -- In das_printfobsstats() and das_printobsstats() changed filtering by
      depth intervals: z > z1 && z <= z2 became z >= z1 && z < z2.
v. 1.93.2
   PS 12032019
   - Another follow-on fix to v1.93.0.
v. 1.93.1
   PS 12032019
   - A follow-on fix to v1.93.0.
v. 1.93.0
   PS 12032019
   -- Added entry ALIAS to obstypes parameter file that if specified is to be
      used instead of the variable name. The purpose is to handle situations
      when the surface field and 3D field of the same variable have different
      asynchronous settings.
v. 1.92.5
   PS 12032019
   -- Modified reader_cmems_standard() to skip and continue on an invalid QC
      flag value.
v. 1.92.4
   PS 08032019
   -- Modified das_updatefields() for the case "--output-increment" to set
      increment to 0 not only if the field element is too large, but also if
      it is is NaN.
v. 1.92.3
   PS 06032019
   -- Modified readfield() to ignore k if there is only one vertical field in
      the file.
v. 1.92.2
   PS 04032019
   -- Fixed obs_add() to handle PARAMETER MAXDEPTH in relevant readers. Thanks
      to Roger Scott for the bug report.
v. 1.92.1

   -- Two technical fixes in das_updatefields() and writerow() to handle case
      with top layer id != 0.
v. 1.92.0
   PS 01032019
   -- Added parameter MAXDEPTH to reader_xy_gridded(), reader_xy_scattered(),
      reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xyz_scattered(), reader_xyh_gridded().
   -- Tidied up code for MINDEPTH in reader_rads_standard(),
      reader_rads_standard2(), reader_viirs().
v. 1.91.13
   PS 01022019
   -- Removed re-seeding from addnoise(); modified enkf_init() to ensure that
      the random number generator is initialised randomly for each process.
v. 1.91.12
   PS 31012019
   -- Re-seeded rand48() with the variable ID in addnoise() to make sure that
      different random sequences are used for different variables.
   -- Changed name model_getvardims() to model_getvargriddims().
v. 1.91.11
   PS 29012019
   -- Replaced model_randomisefield() by addnoise() that enforces zero ensemble
      mean of the added perturbations.
v. 1.91.10
   PS 29012019
   -- Added global parameters "version" and "alpha" to pointlogs.
v. 1.91.9

   -- Fixed enkf_printcompileflags() for the flag NCW_SKIPSINGLE.
v. 1.91.8

   -- Fixed X5 in pointlog files for SCHEME = ETKF.
v. 1.91.7
   PS 22012019

v. 1.91.6
   PS 21012019
   -- A minor correction in usage message.
v. 1.91.5
   PS 06122018
   -- Added a few checks in reader_xy_scattered() and reader_xyz_scattered().
v. 1.91.4
   PS 05122018
   -- Skip writing a variable to a pointlog if they are on different grids.
v. 1.91.3
   PS 28112018

   -- Fixed defect in reader_xyz_gridded().
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.

   -- Added option "--use-existing-transforms" to CALC.
v. 1.90.4
   PS 23112018
   -- A few changes in kdtree.c. The main one concerns the search of nodes
      within specified distance from a location, where individual allocations
      where replaced by allocations of blocks of 1024 nodes.
v. 1.90.3
   PS 21112018
   -- A few minor changes in obs_read() and obs_write().
v. 1.90.2
   PS 20112018
   -- Introduced compile flag MINIMISE_ALLOC in CALC, which aims at eliminating
      the largest sources of dynamic memory allocation during calculating
      transforms, which can cause OOM problems on very large system. (Nothing
      is supposed to change for default setting.)
v. 1.90.1
   PS 14112018
   -- Updated to ncw v2.23.2: it now removes skipping singleton dimensions by
      default in ncw_copy_vardef(); one needs to define NCW_SKIPSINGLE to
      activate it.
v. 1.90.0
   PS 13112018
   -- Added PREP parameter "--no-thinning".
v. 1.89.17
   PS 12112018

      in das_create().
v. 1.89.16
   PS 12112018
   -- reader_amsr2_standard(): ignore option ADD_BIAS if variable "sses_bias"
      does not exist.
v. 1.89.15
   PS 09112018
   -- Added MPI_Type_commit()/MPI_Type_free() after MPI_Type_contiguous().
      Seems to be necessary, but surprisingly OpenMPI worked without it, while
      Intel-MPI crashed.
v. 1.89.14
   PS 06112018
   -- Fixed a few minor memory allocation/deallocation mismatches.
v. 1.89.13

   -- Modified dasystem.h to undefine HE_VIASHMEM when MPI is not defined.
v. 1.89.11
   PS 01112018
   -- Modified default behaviour in enkf_calc.c:main() to exit with error if
      there are no observations; use "--ignore-no-obs" to proceed cleanly.
v. 1.89.10
   PS 01112018
   -- Modified reading depth in reader_cmems_standard(). Now for each datum
      the first valid depth value out of four candidate variables is used.
v. 1.89.9
   PS 31102018
   -- A number of minor changes in HE stuff, supposed to be cosmetic.
v. 1.89.8
   PS 29102018
   -- A number of minor, mostly cosmetic, changes.
v. 1.89.7
   PS 27102018

   -- ncw_copy_vardef(): fixed a defect and modified for multiple unlimited
      dimensions.
v. 1.89.5
   PS 25102018
   -- Fixed defect introduced in v1.89.3 in writefield() and writerow() (handle
      # records = 0).
v. 1.89.4
   PS 24102018
   -- Fixed an internal overflow in multiplication at calculating the size of
      the HE array in das_getHE(). This defect manifested in large systems only.
v. 1.89.3
   PS 23102018
   -- Replaced utils.c:hasunlimdim() by ncw.c:ncw_var_hasunlimdim().
v. 1.89.2
   PS 18102018
   -- Added ADDBIAS parameter to reader_amsr2_standard() (initially implemented
      by Xinmei Huang).
v. 1.89.1
   PS 18102018
   -- A bit of tidying up.
v. 1.89.0
   PS 17102018
   -- Introduced entries "DOMAIN" in the grid parameter file and "DOMAINS" in
      the obstypes parameter file. They provide a mechanism for disconnecting
      observations of a given type from updating variables on certain grids.
      (See sec. 2.7.8 "Domains" of the User Guide.)
v. 1.88.4
   PS 15102018
   -- Corrected island() to handle the case when Z axis is directed towards the
      surface.
v. 1.88.3
   PS 26092018

      get correct counts of observations of each type.
v. 1.88.2
   PS 24092018
   -- Removed assertion z >= 0 in mldtaper().
v. 1.88.1
   PS 21092018
   -- Fixed a defect in model_addorreplacedata().
v. 1.88.0
   PS 20092018
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded(), reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xy_scattered(),
      reader_xyz_scattered() to allow multiple instances of QC flags (e.g.
      for the observed variable and coordinates). In prep_utils.c created
      get_lonname()m get_latname(), get_zname(), get_timename(), get_qcflags()
      for common treatment in readers.
v. 1.87.1
   PS 17092018
   -- Added updating the count of thinned observations to obs_superob().
v. 1.87.0
   PS 17092018
   -- To deal with data from high-frequency instruments -- modified
      obs_superob() to thin superobed observations made at the same location.
      Added STATUS_THINNED to mark the obs being thinned; modified
      print_obsstats() to report the number of thinned obs in PREP.
v. 1.86.3
   PS 14092018
   -- Corrected the code for counting the number of unique locations in
      reader_cmems_standard(). Added this code to reader_cars_standard().
v. 1.86.2
   PS 13092018
   -- Modified island() to check whether the cell is above the bottom rather
      than whether the column is on land or not.
v. 1.86.1
   PS 12092018
   -- Fixed a defect in obs_superob() that (extremely rarely) manifested as
      "Assertion `o->status == 0' failed".
v. 1.86.0
   PS 12092018
   -- Included printing description of the superob itself when running PREP
      with --describe-superob.
v. 1.85.10
   PS 10092018
   -- Moved field "batch" in "struct observation" from "short int" to "int"
      because of the overflow caused by drifter boys data from CMEMS.
v. 1.85.9
   PS 07092018
   -- In reader_cmems_standard() - changed time variable from JULD_LOCATION
      to JULD.
v. 1.85.8
   PS 06092018
   -- Added a few checks on whether all data for a variable is missing in
      reader_cmems_standard().
v. 1.85.7
   PS 06092018
   -- A few relatively minor changes in reader_cmems_standard(),
      reader_xy_gridded(), and reader_xyz_gridded(), some log related, others
      qcflag handling related.
v. 1.85.6
   PS 06092018
   -- Corrected descroiption of the reader in the header of reader_cmems.c.
v. 1.85.5
   PS 05092018

      kind in the file.
v. 1.85.4
   PS 05092018
   -- Corrected defect in calculating the number of unique locations in
      reader_mmt_standard() and reader_cmems_standard().
v. 1.85.3
   PS 05092018
   -- Corrected depth input in reader_cmems_standard().
v. 1.85.2
   PS 05092018
   -- Corrected qcflag input in reader_cmems_standard().
v. 1.85.1
   PS 05092018
   -- Corrected time input in reader_cmems_standard().
v. 1.85.0
   PS 05092018
   -- Added reader_cmems_standard() for profiles from Copernicus.
v. 1.84.11
   PS 30082018
   -- Updated ncw.[ch] to v2.21.0.
v. 1.84.10
   PS 29082018
   -- Modified das_setnmem() to exit with error if the detected ensemble size is
      less than the specified one.
   -- Some trivial changes in stringtable.[ch].
v. 1.84.9
   PS 24082018
   -- Passed corrections made in v1.83.15 in reader_xy_gridded.c to
      reader_xyz_gridded.c.
v. 1.84.8
   PS 17082018
   -- Added another barrier in enkf_calc.c::main().
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.7
   PS 16082018
   -- Added a barrier in das_calcinnandspread() that is supposed to fix a
      rarely (but consistently when it does) manifested defect with HE_VIASHMEM.
      Thanks to Roger Scott for the bug report.
v. 1.84.6
   PS 16082018
   -- Moved the barrier introduced in v1.84.4 to a (hopefully) better position.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.5
   PS 15082018
   -- Modified st_add() to handle the recent replacement st_add_ifabsent() by
      st_add() + check (which is more robust, I guess) in obs_read(): it now
      simply returns (not quits) if the existing entry has the same ID as the
      requested ID.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.4
   PS 15082018
   -- Put a barrier in enkf_calc.c::main() that is supposed to fix occasional
      HDF errors.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.3
   PS 14082018
   -- Fixed (I hope) a defect in das_writevcorrs() sometimes manifested in
      segfaults.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.2
   PS 14082018
   -- Fixed reading of products and instruments from "observations.nc" in
      obs_read(). (This defect was probably hanging from 1.83.10.)
v. 1.84.1
   PS 13082018
   -- Fixed defect introduced in v1.83.14.
      Thanks to Roger Scott and Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 1.84.0
   PS 13082018
   -- find_files(): merged pull request by Hugo Oliveira (to allow opendap
      access).
v. 1.83.15
   PS 07082018
   -- Fixed 2 defects in regard to qcflag in reader_xy_gridded().
      Thanks to Hugo Oliveira for drawing attention.
v. 1.83.14
   PS 03082018
   -- A fix in enkf_calc() that prevents of processes other than rank = 0 write
      the modified errors to observations.nc.
   -- A cosmetic change in das_writeinflation().
v. 1.83.13
   PS 02082018
   -- Fixed defects in regard to qcflag in reader_xy_gridded().
      Thanks to Hugo Oliveira for the tip.
   -- Updated ncw.[ch] to v2.20.0.
v. 1.83.12
   PS 30072018
   -- Another correction to obs_read().
v. 1.83.11
   PS 30072018
   -- Corrected obs_read() to take care of the recently added attribute
      "long_name" for some variables.
   -- Corrected (I hope) the report of the report on subgrid variability in
      PREP.
v. 1.83.10
   PS 27072018
   -- Added "long_name" attribute to variables in observations.nc and
      observations-orig.nc.
v. 1.83.9
   PS 23072018
   -- Modified readfield(), writefield(), read3dfield(), writerow() for
      (hopefully) more robust handling of the fill value and valid range. Not
      expected to have any effect in majority of existing applications.
v. 1.83.8
   PS 20072018
   -- In reader_mmt_standard() -- allow to proceed if no flags TEMP_BLUELINK_QC
      or PSAL_BLUELINK_QC are found.
v. 1.83.7
   PS 16072018
   -- A minor modification in writefield().
v. 1.83.6
   PS 16072018
   -- A minor modification in readfield().
v. 1.83.5
   PS 10072018
   -- A minor but potentially important fix in das_writevcorrs() (it ensures
      that vcorr.nc is created only once).
v. 1.83.4
   PS 06072018
   -- Added QCFLAGNAME and QCFLAGVALS to reader_xy_scattered(),
      reader_xy_gridded(), reader_xyz_gridded(), reader_xyh_gridded().
v. 1.83.3
   PS 05072018
   -- Eliminated enquiry about dimension "nobs" in reader_xy_scattered().
v. 1.83.2
   PS 05072018
   -- Eliminated enquiry about dimension "nobs" in reader_xyz_scattered() (for
      now).
   -- Modified obsprm_read() to enable reading multiple parameter values.
v. 1.83.1
   PS 05072018
   -- Added QCFLAGNAME and QCFLAGVALS to reader_xyz_scattered() (for now).
   -- Added prmfname to struct obsmeta for better error messaging in readers.
v. 1.83.0
   PS 29062018
   -- Modified superob grid so that the centres of superob cells now coincide
      with the nodes of the grid for the corresponding model variable.
      This addresses the "second problem" reported by Hugo Oliveira in
      https://github.com/sakov/enkf-c/issues/5.
v. 1.82.4
   Hugo Oliveira 27062018
   -- Fixed bugs for sigma introduced in v1.81.0.
v. 1.82.3
   PS 26062018
   -- A fix of a defect in ncw_copy_vardef() that often prevented creating
      unlimited dimension.
   -- A few fixes in update.c that make it possible to calculate forecast
      spread without running CALC (note that one needs to comment out point
      log specs in the main parameter file for it).
v. 1.82.2
   PS 25062018
   -- A minor fix in ncw_copy_vardef() to deal with unlimited dimensions.
   -- A minor (supposedly cosmetic) rewrite in traceprod().
v. 1.82.1
   PS 22062018
   Modified ncw_copy_vardef() to handle the case when some of the dimensions
   of the variable being copied already exist in the destination file and have
   different length. This manifested in errors during assembly of spread.nc
   (and, I guess, inflation.nc).
v. 1.82.0
   PS 19062012
   Harmonised specifying LOCRAD in the main parameter file with that in the
   obstypes parameter file. Replaced WEIGHT by LOCWEIGHT.
v. 1.81.2
   PS 18062018
   A bit of clean-up; in particular removed asynchronous entries from struct
   enkfprm, as they belong now to struct obstype.
v. 1.81.1
   PS 18062018
   Cosmetic changes; in particular renamed obsmeta.[ch] to obsprm.[ch].
v. 1.81.0
   PS 15062018
   Modified code for sigma coordinate to permit stretching as described in
   https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Vertical_S-coordinate, Vstretching = 5
   (Vstretching = 2..4 did not require that, and Vstretching = 1 corresponds to
   the "old" stretching function (1) that is not handled in EnKF-C).
v. 1.80.9
   PS 14062018
   Corrected calculation of zt[] in gz_sigma_z2fk() and in grid_fk2z() for
   "g->vtype == GRIDVTYPE_SIGMA" in the case when hc != 0.
   Thanks to Frank Colberg for the bug report and correction.
v. 1.80.8
   PS 12062018
   Cosmetically modified stringtable.[ch].
v. 1.80.7
   PS 12062018
   A few minor changes to make sure that the system runs fine when nobs = 0 (and
   CALC is run with --ignore-no-obs).
v. 1.80.6
   PS 08062018
   A correction in reader_xy_gridded().
v. 1.80.4
   PS 07062018
   Re-wrote das_writecorrs() for better parallelisation.
v. 1.80.3
   PS 07062018
   -- Multiple technical changes. Among substantial ones: it seems that the
      lon/lat coordinate order in reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xyz_gridded()
      has been swapped (i.e. lat was assumed to be the innermost one).
v. 1.80.2
   PS 07062018
   -- Some internal reshuffling, mainly concerning reading/writing of the
      fields, and also of das_writecorrs(), which seems too slow.
v. 1.80.1
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-vertical-correlations".
v. 1.80.0
   PS 06062018
   -- Added UPDATE option "--calculate-forecast-spread". This skips calculating
      analysis spread.
v. 1.79.2
   PS 04062018
   -- Trying to work through occasional problems arising when trying to put
      spreads of each variable (normally stored in different files) into common
      "spread.nc". This fix targets a particular MOM feature that creates output
      files with dimension names xaxis_1, yaxis_1, zaxis_1 regardless of those
      of the grids the variables are defined on... Therefore: in
      ncw_copy_vardef() -- do not create outer limited dimensions of size 1.
v. 1.79.1
   PS 01062018
   -- A minor change in model_create() to permit case sensitive grid names.
v. 1.79.0
   PS 30052018
   -- In reader_mmt.c: only use data with TEMP_BLUELINK_QC (for T) or
      PSAL_BLUELINK_QC (for S) = 0.
v. 1.78.0
   PS 21052018
   -- Shifted transform used for updating an observation at (fi, fj) from
      ((int) fi, (int) fj) to ((int) (fi + 0.5), (int) (fj + 0.5)). This is
      supposed to be more consistent, but inpractice makes a very little
      difference.
v. 1.77.1
   PS 09052018
   -- Added an error message in das_setnmem() to print the name of the missing
      model file when nmem = 0.
v. 1.77.0
   PS 03052018
   -- Added capability to limit the number of observations of each type used
      in local analyses via entries NLOBSMAX in the main and obstypes parameter
      files.
v. 1.76.5
   PS 01052018
   -- Removed what supposed to be a check on positive layer thicknesses in
      gz_hybrid_create(), as one needs to run it on the layer coordinates rather
      than on at/ac/bt/bc coefficients, and for that one needs to know the
      (approximate) surface pressure that seems unavailble at that point.
v. 1.76.4
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected assertions at the end of gz_z_create() and gz_sigma_create() to
      work for 1-layer model (replaced < by <=).
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.
v. 1.76.3
   PS 01052018
   -- Corrected error message in reader_xyh_gridded(). 
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the report.

   PS 30042018
   -- Removed redundant declarations in model.h.
v. 1.76.1
   PS 27042018
   -- Corrected update_HE() and update_Hx() in the case -DHE_VIASHMEM. This is
      a relatively minor correction that should improve calcuation of analysis
      observation stats.
v. 1.76.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Moved specification of ZSTATINTS from the main parameter file to the grid
      parameter file.
      NOTE: this may require update of the existing parameter files.
v. 1.75.0
   PS 27042018
   -- Removed redundant struct obsdomain in enkfprm.h.
v. 1.74.13
   PS 24042018
   -- Corrected defect in distribute_iterations() introduced in v1.74.1
v. 1.74.12
   PS 23042018
   -- das_getHE(): a correction of the ensemble size in the case
      (das->mode == MODE_ENOI && enkf_fstatsonly).
v. 1.74.11
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx() and update_HE().
v. 1.74.10
   PS 20042018
   -- A few minor modifications in update_Hx() and update_HE() for faster
      cycling of parallel jobs. Increased HE_NPROCMAX from 10 to 20.
v. 1.74.9
   PS 20042018
   -- Do not moderate observations if observations.nc already contains moderated
      obs. Previously, the moderated obs has not been written in this case, but
      still moderated (for the second time).
v. 1.74.8
   PS 20042018
   -- A minor correction in update_Hx(). A few cosmetic (I think) corrections.
v. 1.74.7
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gather_St() (hopefully).
v. 1.74.6
   PS 19042018
   -- Improved gathering of HE with -DHE_VIASHMEM. Removed a few barriers.
v. 1.74.5
   PS 19042018
   -- Mainly barriers to work with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v. 1.74.4
   PS 18042018
   -- A minor correction in update_HE().
v. 1.74.3
   PS 18042018
   -- It seems that MPI_Barrier() is needed before MPI_Allgatherv()...
v. 1.74.2
   PS 18042018
   -- Fixed a defect in the latest version of distribute.c.
v. 1.74.1
   PS 18042018
   -- Limited the number of parallel processes updating HE by
      min(10, nprocesses); otherwhile I/O can become a bottleneck, I think.
v.  v1.74.0
   PS 17042018
   -- Introduced shared memory model for HE in CALC (need to be compiled with
      -DHE_VISHMEM). This is useful for situations when CALC becomes memory
      limited.
   -- Parallelised update_HE() when compiled with -DHE_VIASHMEM.
v. 1.73.1
   PS 10042018
   -- Eliminated an argument in H_fn definition in allhs.h.
v. 1.73.0
   PS 06042018
   -- Using a user defined MPI data type for communicating ensemble obs between
      members rather than MPI_float. This allows to overcome the MPI limit on
      the number of elements (currently 2^31 - 1) that manifests when the number
      of ensemble observations becomes very large (>~ 2.5e8).
   -- A minor modification in enkf_prep to print obs stats when not superobing.
v. 1.72.1
   PS 06042018
   -- A (probably, temporal) fix for a very rarely manifested defect caused by
      the mismatch between the data types used for observation fractional grid
      coordinates when stored in observations.nc (float) and when first
      calculated in data readers (double).
v. 1.72.0
   PS 27032018
   -- Introduced a new parameter EXCLUDEINST in reader_mmt_standard(). Should be
      used as e.g. "PARAMETER EXCLUDEINST = WMO995".
v. 1.71.2
   PS 27032018
   -- A possible bug fix in grid_setlonbase(). A few cosmetic changes in grid.c.
      A minor change in Makefile.
v. 1.71.1
   PS 26032018
   -- A minor modification for Z grids: when ZCVARNAME is specified --
      distinguish cases nkc = nk and nkc = nk + 1.
v. 1.71.0
   PS 26032018
   -- Implemented the "new" ROMS formulation of the vertical sigma coordinate,

v. 1.70.2
   PS 07032018
   -- In utils.c replaced code borrowed from Jdn_L.C for day difference
      calculation by that from Scaldate.C (see
      http://www.diyspeakers.net/snippets.org/c.snippets.org/browser.html).
v. 1.70.1
   PS 06032018
   -- A minor change in error messages in readfield() and read3dfield().
v. 1.70.0
   PS 06032018
   -- Eliminated readfield() and read3dfield(); renamed readfield2() as
      readfield() and read3dfield2() as read3dfield(); modified the rest of the
      code accordingly. This ensures that the dimensions of the fields read are
      always consistent with the assumed dimensions.
v. 1.69.7
   PS 15022018
   -- Tidied up output in print_obsstats().
   -- A few other cosmetic changes.

      a bug in grid_fk2z() for hybrid grids.)
v. 1.69.3
   PS 25012018
   -- Modified z2fk_basic() to handle the case
      zt[i] != 0.5 * (zc[i] + zc[i + 1]).

   -- Modified hybrid grids stuff in grid.c to get robust z <-> k conversions.
v. 1.69.1

      error with -DNO_GRIDUTILS.
v. 1.68.10
   PS 22012018
   -- A minor fix in enkf_prep.c.

      round-up effects.
v. 1.68.6-dev
   PS 19012018
   -- Allow running CALC twice (I hope), just ignoring the previous stuff.
   -- Made sob_stride grid-dependent. SOBSTRIDE = 0 means no superobing on this
      grid.
   -- Tidied and moved handling of array of grids from model.c to grid.c.
   -- Modified grid_xy2fij(), grid_z2fk(), grid_fk2z() to return meaningful
      status (previously done by model_*()).
   -- Changed format of readers -- replaced model* in the argument list by
      grid*.
   -- Added obstypes_set().
v. 1.68.5-dev
   PS 17012018
   -- Added deletion of superobs on land in PREP.
v. 1.68.4-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Added check for superobs being on land in PREP when obs->stride > 1.

   PS 16012018
   -- Eliminated STATUS_ROUNDUP and associated code in model2obs(). Moved
      the associated check to PREP.
   -- Moved calculation of struct observation.model_depth from paticular readers
      to obs_add().
   -- Added island() as an analogue to interpolate2d() used for calculation
      of struct observation.model_depth for situations when there is no depth
      variable defined for a grid.
   -- Synced ncw.[ch] with ncw-c v2.15.
   -- Eliminated STATUS_MISSING as it is not used anymore.
v. 1.68.2-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Brought grid_describeprm() up to date.

      continue").
   -- Started updating the user guide.
v. 1.68.1-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Modified error message in reader_xyh_gridded().
v. 1.68.0-dev
   PS 16012018
   -- Substantial changes in the vertical grid code. The entries XDIMNAME,
      YDIMNAME, ZDIMNAME have been eliminated from the grid parameter file.
      Two new optional parameters have been added:
        - VDIR, with two possible values: FROMSURF (default) and TOSURF;
        - ZCVARNAME.
   -- Added ncw_inq_vardimlen().
v. 1.67.7

v. 1.67.4
   PS 11012018
   -- Updated ncw.c to v2.13 (adds trailing zero to extracted text attribute).
   -- Modified tunits_convert() to understand "hours".
   -- Changed data type of calcstats.nlobs_sum from int to long long int.
v. 1.67.3
   PS 05012018
   -- Corrected a defect in reading INSTRUMENT parameter in reader_xy*()
      procedures.
v. 1.67.2
   PS 04012018
   -- Elaborated observation stats: split "noutside" into "noutside_grid",
      "noutside_obsdomain" and "noutside_obswindow".
v. 1.67.1
   PS 03012018
   -- Changed cycling in reader_xyh_gridded() to make k the fastest index (this
      is supoposed to accelerate fk2z and z2fk conversions).
v. 1.67.0
   PS 03012018
   -- Replaced TODO in obs_create_fromsingleob() by a call to model_fk2z().
v. 1.66.5-dev

v. 1.66.1-dev
   PS 11122017

v. 1.66.0-dev
   PS 11122017
   -- Started implementing hybrid vertical grid.
v. 1.65.8

v. 1.65.2
   PS 24112017
   -- Introduced option "non-centred" for the asynchronous time binning
      intervals. By default the interval 0 is centred about the assimilation
      time. When specified as "non-centred" its start considdes with the
      assimilation time.
v. 1.65.1
   PS 14112017
   -- A minor correction in obstypes_read().
v. 1.65.0
   PS 10112017
   -- Added a new option to enkf_prep: "--no-superobing-across-instruments" to
      make it possible to obtain clean stats on each instrument type.
v. 1.64.4
   PS 09112017
   -- In model_adddata() added a check that the field dimension matches the
      the assumed (model) dimension.
v. 1.64.3
   PS 07112017
   -- Included observations outside strictly defined observation window into
      slot "outside" in observation statistics reported by PREP.
v. 1.64.2
   PS 07112017
   -- "ASYNC 0" is now considered as specifying synchronous DA (i.e. is
      equivalent to the absense of this entry).
v. 1.64.1
   PS 07112017
   -- Modified grid_create() to allow z-grids with no depth specified (e.g. for
      atmosphere). `numlevels' is then simply set to the number of layers
      everywhere.
v. 1.64.0
   PS 07112017
   -- Made observation window observation type dependent. The common observation
      main window still can be set from the main parameter file. For a
      particular observation type it can be overwritten in the obstypes
      parameter file.
v. 1.63.4
   PS 01112017
   -- Added a barrier before removing ".enkftmp".
v. 1.63.3
   PS 01112017
   -- Write tiles for pointlog files in directory ".enkftmp" (used to be written
      in the work directory).
v. 1.63.2
   PS 23102017
   -- Corrected VIIRS reader. Now PARAMETER KIND = 1 or PARAMETER KIND = 2 will
      use the nighttime or dayghlight obs only, and PARAMETER KIND = 3 will use
      all observations.
v. 1.63.1
   PS 19102017
   -- Added optional PARAMETER KIND to reader_viirs_standard().
v. 1.63.0

   -- Added reader_xyz_scattered.c.
v. 1.62.2
   PS 27092017
   -- Fixed (hopefully) a subtle defect in handling periodic grids. It
      manifested in getting weird longitude values for super-observations when
      the collated obs had fi (fractional i indices) both in [ni - 1, ni - 0.5)
      and [ni - 0.5, ni) intervals.
      Thanks to Matt Chamberlain and Russ Fiedler for the bug report.
v. 1.62.1
   PS 26092017
   -- Added optional parameters VARSHIFT and MINDEPTH to
      reader_viirs_standard().
v. 1.62.0
   PS 21092017

      fields.
v. 1.61.6
   PS 15092017 (actually Russ Fiedler)
   -- Corrected the call to MPI_Allgatherv() in ensobs.c:
      MPI_Allgatherv(das->S[my_first_iteration],...) became
      MPI_Allgatherv(MPI_IN_PLACE,...). It seems that the previous version
      started to work dogy with OpenMPI v1.10.2.
v. 1.61.5
   PS 14092017
   -- Removed redundant reader_aquarius.c and reader_smos.c (these data are now
      handled by reader_xy_gridded.c).
v. 1.61.4
   PS 13092017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded() to allow a record dimension with a single
      record only (for now).
v. 1.61.3
   PS 13092017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded() and reader_xy_scattered() to allow NaNs as
      fill values. Necessary to make it possible to use for reading SMOS data.
v. 1.61.2
   PS 15082017
   -- A minor modification in the observation constructor in CALC.
v. 1.61.1
   PS 15082017
   -- A change to permit variable names in the state vector (defined in the
      model prm file) different by case only, e.g.: t and T, u and U etc.
v. 1.61.0
   PS 15082017
   -- Made STRIDE grid dependent.
v. 1.60.4

v. 1.60.3
   PS 02082017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded.c and reader_xy_scattered.c to allow lack of
      the time variable. Time is assumed then to be at the anaysis time.
v. 1.60.2
   PS 02082017
   -- Modified reader_xy_gridded.c to handle curvilinear grids.
v. 1.60.1
   PS 07062017
   -- Some minor portability related changes in hash.[ch].
v. 1.60.0
   PS 26052017
   -- Corrected (I hope) the sign of the bias correction in the mixed layer in
      subsurface fields. (It should be the same in H_subsurf_wsurfbias() and
      in H_surf_biased().)
v. 1.59.2
   PS 30032017
   -- Introduced and using now str2bool() for reading ISSURFACE entry.
v. 1.59.1
   PS 30032017

   PS 30032017
   -- Replaced KIND entry in observation types parameter file by ISSURFACE.
v. 1.58.0
   PS 29032017
   -- Added two new entries NCFORMAT and NCCOMPRESSION to the main parameter
      file. Consider it experimental at this stage! The defaults remain
      NC-64BIT_OFFSET and no compression.
v. 1.57.0
   PS 29032017
   -- Changed identification of observation types. Each type now is
      characterised by its "observation kind". Currently there are two kinds
      available: "SURFACE" and "SUBSURFACE". There is no longer "ALIAS" and
      "ISSURFACE" entries for observation types.

      ONE MUST MAKE (RATHER MINOR) CHANGES TO OBSTYPES.PRM FILES WHEN UPDATING
      TO THIS VERSION.
v. 1.56.3

   PS 27032017
   -- Added examples/5.
v. 1.56.0
   PS 27032017
   -- Introduced a new optional field "ALIAS" for observation types. This
      allows one to add a new observation type without re-compiling the code.
      This can be useful e.g. for evaluating a new instrument (by getting an
      independent statistics for the new instrument and seeing the change in
      statistics for the old instruments).
v. 1.55.4
   PS 24032017
   -- Added 0.17 to H8 SST to get the foundation temperature.
v. 1.55.3
   PS 23032017

   -- On multi-grid model - modified plog_writestatevars_direct() and
     plog_writestatevars_toassemble() to skip writing variables from grids
     other than the native one for a given pointlog (this could try to access

v. 1.45.2
   PS 18082016
   -- Slightly modified update_HE() and update_Hx() to fix a once-in-a-lifetime
      round-off error occuring after writing and reading `fi' to observations.nc
      as a float.
   -- Changed `id_orig' in observations.nc to correspond to the observation
      number as read from data files rather than to the id in

   PS 28062016
   -- Minor structural changes for struct obstype -- now can depend on an
      arbitrary number of model variables specified after the entry VAR in

      increments (before it was "_an" regardless).
v. 1.37.0
   PS 24032016

   -- Replaced isend/bcast calls in das_getHE() with allgatherv
v. 1.34.0
   PS 11032016
   -- Made sure that in single observation experiments (options
      --single-observation-xyz or --single-observation-ijk of enkf_calc) for
      surface obs types the observation layer/depth is set to surface
      regardless of the entered value
v. 1.33.0
   PS 03032016
   -- Adding parameter "ADD" to the RADS reader to make it possible to revert
      a correction to SLA
v. 1.32.4

   -- A minor fix: replaced a number ofcalls to abs() by fabs() in grid.c
v. 1.32.3
   PS 17022016
   -- Added examples/4 to demonstrate a multi-grid setting.

      in grid_spec.nc files.
v. 1.32.2
   PS 16022016
   -- Beautified examples/2/Makefile
   -- Added examples/3 to demonstrate using masked curvilinear grid in PREP
v. 1.32.1
   PS 16022016
   -- Bug fix for the previous version.
   -- Put in examples/2. It is exactly as example 1 except that the grid is
      set aas curvilinear (although in fact it is rectangular in lon/lat).
v. 1.32.0
   PS 12022016
   Made changes in the grid code to enable handling of ORCA grids. Also
   simplified the structure of the grid code -- got rid of dynamic functions,
   now using simple "if" cycles instead. Added grid_ij2xy() to make it possible
   to get cell's coordinates when necessary without parsing the whole grid into
   a spatial binary tree.

   In regard ORCA grids the workflow is as follows.
   1. Make a complementary grid with masked nodes around two poles in the
      northern hemisphere and along the line connecting these nodes. Run PREP
      with this grid. It will be fully mapped at a cost that a very small
      percent of obs along the line connecting the two poles will be ignored.
   2. Run CALC and POST with the normal grid.

   PS 09122015
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 1.29.0
   PS 30112015
   -- Modified code to allow arbitrary range for the grid longitude.
      The range is now defined by the grid.lonbase field:
      lon range = [lonbase, lonbase + 360). (Used to be allowed either
      [-180, 180) or [0, 360) only.)
v. 1.28.3
   PS 17112015
   -- Modified gridprm_create() to make sure that the entry NAME is entered
      first when initialising a new grid.

   -- Corrected a defect in reading multiple LOCRAD nd WEIGHT entries in
      obstypes parameter file.

v. 1.29.0
   PS 03122015
   Made entries "NUMLEVELSVARNAME" for Z grids or "MASKVARNAME" for sigma grids

v. 1.28.1
   PS 03122015
   -- Cosmetic changes.
v. 1.28.0
   PS 30112015
   -- Made changes that suppose to make it possible multi-scale localisation.

v. 1.26.11
   PS 26102015
   -- Allowed comments (starting with "#") after definition of pointlog in the

   -- Fixed inconsistency between insert and search keys in ht_plogs.
v. 1.26.6

   -- Reversed 1.26.3; instead write the "actual" transform to the point log
      only for if field.id == 0.
v. 1.26.5
   PS 15102015
   -- Corrected a (recently introduced) defect in g2_xy2fij() that filtered
      latitude according to the longitude range (-180 to 180 or 0 to 360).
v. 1.26.4
   PS 15102015
   -- Corrected log printing in model_print().
v. 1.26.3
   PS 14102015

   -- Generate error on unknown parameter in observation parameter file.
v. 1.26.1
   PS 13102015

   -- Introduced alpha -- moderating parameter in DEnKF and ETKF.
v. 1.23.5

      parameter MINDEPTH.
v. 1.22

v. 1.21
   PS 04092015
   -- During superobing - calculate std of the subgrid variability (in a rather
      crude way) and use <obs error std> = max(<obs error std>, <subgrid std>).
v. 1.20
   PS 03092015
   -- Switched off writing obs to observations-orig.nc when enkf_prep is run
      with --no-superobing.

   PS 31082015
   -- Modified code to allow point logs to be specified on any grid by entering
      the grid name as an additional parameter in the pointlog entry. Grid 0
      will still be used as default.
v. 1.18
   PS 31082015
   -- Verified that setting LOCRAD and STRIDE to big numbers results in
      calculating a global analysis. Made some changes to the code to ensure
      that it runs with such setings, even when using more than one CPU in calc.
      Added target "global" to example 1.
v. 1.17
   PS 27082015
   -- Made writing analyses to separate files (rather than appending to forecast
      files) the default action. The former option "--separate-output" became
      redundant, a new option "--joint-analysis" appends analysis to forecast
      files.
v. 1.16
   PS 26082015

      type. The common value can now be overriden for  particular obs. type
      in the observation types parameter file.
v. 1.07
   PS 29072015
   -- Added a new option to enkf_update: --write-inflation. (It only takes

v. 1.06.1
   PS 23072015
   -- Fixed a defect -- checking that plogs do actually exist before working
      on them.
      Thanks to Paul Sandery for reporting.
v. 1.06
   PS 22072015
   -- Added capability to define the limiting multiple for inflation (remains

   PS 09072015
   -- Added AMSRE reader.
v. 1.04
   PS 09072015

      `das->updatespec & UPDATE_OUTPUTINC'.
v. 1.03
   PS 08072015
   -- Unified specifications for enkf_update -- they are now all in the variable
      `updatespec'.
   -- Introduced a new option in enkf_update "-no-fields-update".
v. 1.02
   PS 22062015
   -- Made land test in das_updatefields() and das_updatebg() depth dependent.
      For now assume that the layeres are counted down from the surface (for Z
      models).

      written to the pointlog files (as "X5_actual" or "w_actual").
v. 0.99
   PS 16062015
   -- Modified pointlog code to write both analysis and forecast variables (was
      analysis only).
   -- Corrrected spread calculation (replaced /(m-1) by /m).
   -- Changed sprintf() to snprintf() throughout the code.
v. 0.98
   PS 03062015
   -- Fixed a (minor) inconsistency that led to assertion failure in some
      single observation experiments.
v. 0.97.3
   PS 11052015
   -- Corrected a defect in utils.c: replaced "sort_r()" by "qsort_r()" to
      compile correctly for systems with no qsort_r().
v. 0.97.2
   PS 08052015
   -- Added a new procedure utils.c::int getnumlevels(char fname[], char
      varname[]) and use it in H_surf_standard() to test whether the model file
      has been stripped to contain the surface layer only or not. (This is
      necessary when the top layer is not k = 0.)
   -- Added a few assertions to readfield() and writefield().
v. 0.97.1
   PS 06052015
   -- Added parameter `hastosucceed' to model_getvarid().
v. 0.97
   PS 05052015
   -- Set quit function for gridutils to enkf_quit. This change requires
      upgrade to the latest version of libgu (v. 0.54).

      Thanks to Paul Sandery for the bug report.
v. 0.95
   PS 12022015
   -- Modified code to be able to proceed with nobs = 0; introduced a new option

      systems with old glibc; based on public code sort_r.h by Isaac Turner.)
v. 0.93
   Paul Sandery 30012015
   -- Added a reader for AMSR-2.
v. 0.92.3
   PS 30012015

v. 0.92.2
   PS 16012015
   -- Modified H_surf_standard() and H_surf_biased() to read the actual level
      of the surface variable.
v. 0.92.1
   PS 16012015
   -- Made DEPTHVARNAME optional for a grid; an error is generated in
      model_getdepth() if it is not set for the grid the variable is defined on.
   -- Made the inflation limited by half of the magnitude of the spread
      reduction.
v. 0.92
   PS 06012015
   -- Added a strict check on keywords in obstypes parameter file. Corrected
      obstypes parameter file in example 1 (replaced MIN and MAX by MINVALUE and
      MAXVALUE). Removed redundant explicit call to das_setobstypes() in
      enkf_calc.c made in the case of singleob.
   -- Corrected handling of obs error from file in obs_add().
   -- Made a few changes towards achieving consistency in handling grid
      periodicity. Affected interpolate2d(), interpolate3d(), grid_xy2fij().
   -- Do not calculate transforms for a grid in das_calctransforms() if there
      are no model variable associated with it.
   -- Corrected das_updatefields() to work in the case STRIDE = 1.
v. 0.91
   PS 12122014
   -- Structural changes: no more `models' directory. Instead, grid
      specifications now require VTYPE (currently can be either "z" or "sigma").
v. 0.90
   PS 17122014
   -- Corrected defect in verticall mapping.
      Thanks to Russ Fiedler for the bug report.
   -- Moved `gridprm' stuff to gridprm.[ch].
v. 0.89
   PS 10122014
   -- Added sigma model to enable assimilating with ROMS. Quite substantial
      secondary changes overall.
v. 0.88
   PS 20141120
   -- SUBSTANTIAL structural changes. It is now possible to have multiple grids
      within a model. Each variable is associated with one of the grids. The
      ensemble transforms are calculated separately for each grid. Analysed
      ensembles in pointlogs are produced with the transforms on the grid
      defined first in the grid parameter file, for now.
   -- A correction for the CARS reader: an obs is considered invalid if its
      depth is < 0.
v. 0.87
   PS 20141114
   -- Replaced SRF limited inflation by inflation limited by directly calculated
      spread reduction for each element of the state vector. This is a default
      inflation mode; add PLAIN to the inflation specification in the parameter
      file to use uniform inflation.
v. 0.86
   PS 20141110
   -- The variable-specific inflation set in the model parameter file now simply
      overrides (not multiplies with) the common inflation set in the main
      parameter file.
v. 0.85
   PS 20141103
   -- Added RADS reader "biased" for MDT bias correction with the EnKF.

      when necessary.
   -- Corrected a minor interpolation bug introduced in previous version in
      das_updatefields().
   -- Corrected interpolation bug in fi2x().
v. 0.84
   PS 20141024
   -- in das_updatefields() limited inflation by 1 + SRF.
v. 0.83
   PS 20141013
   -- Added a new parameter "--no-superobing" to enkf_prep.
v. 0.82

      -DNO_GRIDUTILS
v. 0.78
   PS 20140919 (minor changes)
   -- Set batch ID for NAVO and Windsat SST obs to 0 (was -1). This makes it
      possible to identify "bad batches" of these obs on "per file" basis.
v. 0.77
   PS 20140909 (moderate structural changes)
   -- Introduced `struct variable'.
   -- Changed the way the custom model initialisation is done: now it is called
      right after reading the model type; this allows to read other bits in the
      model parameter file in a custom way.
   -- Removed now redundant `struct zmodelprm' in zmodel.c. Added
      zmodel_adddata().
   -- Now read WM__INST_TYPE in MMT reader as the instrument type.
   -- Removed redudant variable `vv' in das_updatefields().
   -- Modified definition of das_updatefields() to make it more general and
      more consistent with other update procedures.
v. 0.76
   PS 20140901
   -- Renamed stage 3 from "post" to "update".
v. 0.75
   PS 20140828
   -- Introduced field `alloctype' in `modeldata' to handle de-allocation.
   -- Made the parameter `nk' in
      model_getdims(model* m, int* ni, int* nj, int* nk) optional (can be NULL
      if not needed).
v. 0.74
   PS 28082014
   -- Moved specification of variables from main parameter file to model
      parameter file.
   -- Modified entry for model data: it now should start with "DATA".
v. 0.73

   -- Reduced number of tiles for point logs by joining tiles for the same
      field for all point logs into one.
v. 0.72
   PS 26082014
   -- Made writing state variables to point log files two-stage, similar
      to other updates: first to tiles, one cpu per tile, and then the final
      "assembly". Added plog_writestatevars_toassemble() and
      plog_assemblestatevars(); plog_writestatevars() became
      plog_writestatevars_direct().
v. 0.71
   PS 20082014
   -- Made structural changes: put observation type related stuff into
      obstypes.[ch]. Introduced new "observation types" parameter file.
      Eliminated `struct obstypedesc' and global variable `obstypedesc
      otdescs[]'. Consolidated all obs type related stuff in
      observations.obstypes field. Moved all obs types related stuff from
      enkfprm_read() to obstypes_read().
   -- Added descriptions of each parameter file used; modified usage to reflect
      this.
   -- Modified obs_add() to report the number of good obs read from each data
      file (along with the total number of obs). Removed this from CARS and
      MMT readers (no longer needed).
   -- In example 1 added a new target "singleob".
v. 0.70
   PS 18082014
   -- Fixed a silly defect in das_writefields_toassemble() (an unecessary cycle
      over ensemble).
v. 0.69
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced obs_checkdatasize() and put it into readers.
v. 0.68
   PS 15082014
   -- Introduced option to specify domains for each type of observations by
      entries "OBSDOMAIN <obs type> <x1> <x2> <y1> <y2> [<z1> <z2>]" in the
      parameter file.
   -- For RADS reader in Neil White's format - only use obs with local_flag = 0.
v. 0.67
   PS 14082014
   -- Made a modification: the entries for standard deviations optionally
      specified in each section of the observation parameter file can now
      also specify the associated arithmetic operation: EQUAL (default),
      PLUS (actually sqrt(std * std + prev * prev)), MULT, MIN, MAX
v. 0.66
   PS 13082014
   -- Made a small correction in readers.
   -- Merged das_create() for calc and post. Added creation of pointlogs for
      post.
   -- Swapped dimensions for S in plog_write().
   -- Introduced field `struct observation.nallocated'.
v. 0.65
   PS 09082014
   -- Eliminated potentially architechture dependent operations with floating
      point in distribute_iterations().
v. 0.64
   PS 08082014
   -- Removed exit by error in distribute_iterations() in the case when the
      number of iterations is less than the number of CPUs. Seems to work fine.
   -- Replaced enkf_calc.c::int fstatsonly by global.c::int enkf_fstatsonly.

   PS 04082014
   -- Rewrote unsortobs_byij() in an economical way, avoiding duplication of S.
v. 0.57
   PS 01082014
   -- Modified das_destandardise() to include restoring obs order by id.
      Simplified das_printobsstats(), das_printfobsstats(dasystem* das)
      and das_calcbatchstats() accordingly.

   PS 14072014
   -- Setting SOBSTRIDE = 0 now switches superobing off.
v. 0.51

   -- Introduced a new option "--no-mean-update" for enkf_calc.
v. 0.38
   PS 27022014
   -- Reshuffle of writing the output by post: now by default it writes analysed

v. 0.37
   PS 21022014
   Bug fix: inflation was not applied properly when running with
